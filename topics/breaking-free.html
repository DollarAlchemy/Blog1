            <h2>Breaking Free from the Default Path</h2>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
            <p>Societal expectations often push people into predefined scripts—career paths, social roles, and habits that may not align with their true selves. Escaping this cycle is key to living an authentic life.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> Viewing abilities as developable fosters continuous learning and helps individuals step outside societal norms (Lenchner et al., 2024).</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Determination Theory:</strong> Autonomy, competence, and relatedness are critical for intrinsic motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Actionable Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Define Your “Why”:</strong>
                    <p>Write down your core values and ask, “What does success look like for me?” Revisit this exercise quarterly.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reframe Failures:</strong>
                    <p>Adopt a mindset where setbacks are seen as data points for growth. Keep a “failure journal” to reflect on lessons learned.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Detach from External Validation:</strong>
                    <p>Limit reliance on societal markers of success (e.g., titles, accolades) and focus on intrinsic rewards.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pro Insight:</h3>
            <p>Challenge assumptions about success by experimenting with alternative lifestyles or career paths. For instance, try freelancing, remote work, or pursuing a creative side project.</p>
