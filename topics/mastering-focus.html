            <h2>Mastering Focus</h2>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
            <p>Focus is the cornerstone of personal growth, allowing you to allocate your energy and attention effectively. Without focus, even the best intentions are scattered and unproductive.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Psychological Impact:</strong> Focus enhances psychological capital, including hope, resilience, and optimism (Meyers et al., 2015).</li>
                <li><strong>Neurological Benefits:</strong> Focus rewires the brain to prioritize essential tasks, strengthening neural pathways associated with goal achievement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Actionable Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Eliminate Distractions:</strong>
                    <p>Designate “focus zones” for work or study, free of unnecessary digital interruptions. Use apps like Forest or Freedom to block distractions.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Practice Mindfulness:</strong>
                    <p>Begin each day with 5-10 minutes of mindfulness or meditation to sharpen your attention. Mindfulness has been shown to improve working memory and reduce task-switching fatigue.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The 90/30 Rule:</strong>
                    <p>Work for 90 minutes in deep focus, then take a 30-minute restorative break. This method aligns with ultradian rhythms, maximizing cognitive performance.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Pro Insight:</h3>
            <p>Integrate focus training into daily routines. For example, spend the first hour of your day on your most challenging tasks, avoiding email and social media until later.</p>
